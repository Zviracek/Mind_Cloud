    <h2>Rex - part 1</h2>
    <div id="perex">
        <p>
            As the name might be confusing for you, a few things have to be clarified.
            It's Rex because of the paint, not because of itself. <br>
            Now confusion aside. Remember when I said that I am a huge Star Wars nerd? Here we are. This is a Star Wars prop. A helmet.
            As the name suggests, it's Captin Rex's helmet. You have been warned, now let's move on.<br>
            Just making one by myself would not be enough. So I decided to add a little bit of electronis into it. After all, I should be an electronics engineer.<br>
            And that's where things would get confusing, and to be one step ahead, I decided to seperate this project into two, in the firs part, which is this, we will discuss creating such a helmet, and in the second part we will focus on the electronis system.
            Deal? Deal. Nice. So we can proceed.

            I better say it loud now, the model is not made by me. As I would love to be able to make one myself, I simply don't have the sill to do that. Yet...<br>
            The model is made by xxx and you can find It at xxx.xxx. The xxx have done amazing job, althroug, the model have some problems, which we will discuss later.<br>
            <br>
            The whole model was separated in pices, which were printed individualy. To be specific there were xx pices alltogether.<br>
            If you have ever made one by yourself, you know what pain it is to print these. If you didn't, I will make it short. It was about 144 hours of print time. If you wonder, week has 168.
            That's huge amount of time and it don't even consider the time to prepare printer between prints.
            By the way, it was slightly over 1 kg of filament worth material. I have chosen PET-G, because I heard a few recomendations that it is easier to sand than PLA, which I would chose otherwise.
            If you wonder, PET-G is some kind of compromis between ABS and PLA. If you want more, I am not the kind of person which should you ask, because you now know exactly everythink I do, probably even more.
            <br>
            So around a week for just printing, what about the time it takes after that.
            That would be xxx.
