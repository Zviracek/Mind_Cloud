    <h2>Home lightning system</h2>

        <p>
            For some time now, I wanted to have some kind of smart home. Who doesn't after all? But taking the privacy security risk by buying one from retail*.
            Call me paranoid if you wan't, but that thread is serious. <br>
            I know I can use some kind of open source, but that is so much work for a little in exchange.<br>
            So I have decided to go with even more work but with experience in exchange. :) Yes, I am building one by myself.
            This should be the first part of this large scale project. And we should start with something easy. Lighting you say? Ok, that sounds easy, right? So let's make it hard.<br>
            Becouse of complexity that I plan, I thing I am going to separate this project into two parts. This is the first one. We will call it HLS Mk.1
