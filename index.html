                Welcome in Mind Cloud. <br>
                The place I store some kind of backup of my finnished or undergoing projects. It is supposed to serve as some kind of sharing my experience with building various things.
                And also, and I would lie if I say otherwise, to share my accomplisments. :) <br>
                I hope you can find some valuable informations as I did while failing and succeeding these projects.<br>
                If you have any kind of question or suggestion to improve anything, don't be affraid to contact me. I will be greatfull for any feedback.
