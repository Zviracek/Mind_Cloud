            <h2>Hello there</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Jan or Honza, in translation Jon. But i like to call myslef Zvířák or Zviracek.<br>
                I am Electrical engineering student, especialy cybernetics student. But I am also space enthusiazist, Starship fan and huge Star Wars nerd.<br>
                For some time I was thinking about creating my own blog. Just to share my experience, approach and sometimes even result. So here we are.
                This would be the place where I will describe my journy through different projects, share my experience and hopefully pass some knowlage.<br>
                At this time, I am prioritizing other work than writing this blog, but I am planning to share them once I finnish them. So sit back and wait, It might be next year or tomorow. :P
