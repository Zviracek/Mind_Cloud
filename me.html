        Hi, my name is Jan or Honza, in translation Jon. But i like to be called Zvířák or Zviracek.<br>
        I am Electrical engineering student, especialy cybernetics student. But I am also space enthusiazist, Starship fan and huge Star Wars nerd.<br>
        For some time I was thinking about creating my own blog. Just to share my experience, approach and sometimes even result. So here we are.
        This would be the place where I will describe my journy through different projects, share my experience and hopefully pass some knowledge.<br>
        At this time, I am prioritizing other work than writing this blog, but I am planning to share them once I finnish them. So sit back and wait, It might be next year or tomorow. :P
